> ## Documentation
> Documentation is the idea of documenting your procedures for your experiment so that an outsider could understand the workings > of your lab. 
> This can include where your results and working data are saved.

* Copy your lab notebook if you have one onto a digital format and save it to a safe place (such as research storage). 
* Make sure these are saved somewhere that's accessible to your supervisor/team. 

## Bus Factor

Have you got a new staff member coming onboard to your team? They are a prime candidate to collate information and document as it will help them become familiar to the team and learn how the lab/team works.

Note:
Ideally you want to document anything that a lab member coming on board would need to know. Documentation is all about changing your Bus Factor - how many people on a project would need to be hit by a bus to make a project fail. Many times, projects can have a bus factor of one. Adding documentation means when someone goes on leave, needs to take leave suddenly or finishes their study, their work is preserved for your lab.

> ## Documentation helps with reproducible science
> Documentation will also be important for any audits in your lab or if someone would like to reproduce your research.

> ## How do we start? - Beginners
> Read this first: [How to start Documenting and more by CESSDA ERIC](https://www.cessda.eu/Training/Training-Resources/Library/Data-Management-Expert-Guide/2.-Organise-Document/Documentation-and-metadata){:target="_blank"}.
> Start with documenting in a text file or document - *any start is a good start*. 
> Have this document automatically synced to the cloud with your data or keep this in a shared place that your 
> organisation supports and recommends.
{: .challenge}

> ## How do we start? - Intermediate
> Once you have the basics in place, go into detail on how your workflow goes from your raw data to the finished results. 
> This can be anything from a downloaded function list from SPSS/Virtual Lab to the code used to create it. 
{: .challenge}

> ## How do we start? - Advanced
> Now that you've got a good head start, time to learn about Git Repositories and wikis.
