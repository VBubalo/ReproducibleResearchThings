## What is Reproducible Research?

No one wants their research to be `retracted`

* some data were missing
* untracked version of changes
* mistakes were made
  * true error
  * fraud
  
---

### Today we are going to learn 9 lessons to safeguard us against these situations

---

### Let's look at some scenarios....

---

### What if a key person from your lab disappeared one day? 
(family or personal emergency, no longer contactable)

---


@snap[south span-100]
@[1-5]* Could you all continue your work?
@[6-9]* Would you know where all `the data` is stored?
@[10-15]* Could you keep running effectively for 1 month?
@[15-19]`1 year?`

### Let's look at a few tools we can use to protect our research

---

## Documentation
### Naming Conventions
### Folder Structures
### Automation
### Version Control

---

## Step1 
## Documentation

---

## Step2
## Naming Conventions

--- 

## Step 3 
## Folder Structures

---

## Step 4
## Automation

---

## Step 5
## Version Control

---

### Great! 
By implementing these steps, we've already improved our processes!

`Now if someone leaves our lab, we're covered!`

---

### Next Scenario....

---

### Imagine your laptop and hard drives are lost or damaged? 

---

* Could you continue your work?
* Is your data backed up?
* Encrypted?

---

### Let's look at a few tools we can use to protect our research

---

### Backing up to the cloud
### Computer Security
### Deidentifying your data

---

---

## Step6
## Cloud Backup

--- 

Note:
While Computer security isn't really about reproducibility, it is important. Plus I wanted to highlight encrypting hard drives

---

## Step 7
## Computer Security

--- 

## Step 8
## Deidentifying your data

--- 

### So now we have some new skills up our sleeve
### If our laptop goes missing, we are better prepared

---
Now let's look at after a project has finished

---

### Next Scenario....

---

Someone has published contradicting results to your published paper, and you've been asked to provide your data and methods. 

`Could you?`

---

We're already covered some things that can help us

---

* Storing our data in the cloud
* Documentation
* Versions of software

---

## Step 9
## Digital Object Identifier (DOI) and Persistent identifier (PiD)

---

Wow, that's 9 Reproducible Research things! 

---

What if we look at another scenario?

---

if a research partner organization believes your "sensitive" data has been made available to others (ie a data breach). Could you show that steps were taken to avoid this or show that it couldn't happen?

---

Turns out, we can!

---

* Owncloud or Research Space – tracing who you have shared a file (Step 6 Cloud Backups)
* Computer encryption (Step 7 Good Computer Safety)
* General good computer safety – unique passwords and use Multi factor Auth when possible (Step 7 Good Computer Safety)
* Separating identified variables (Step 8- Deidentifying your data)

---

Amazing! We have so many new skills!

---

What changes are you going to make?
